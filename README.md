# 📘 Introduction to Data Structures in Python

Welcome to the **Introduction to Data Structures in Python** repository!  
This repo is designed for learners who want to understand and implement the **core data structures** in Python from scratch. Instead of relying on built-in types, we code them manually to gain a deeper understanding of how they work under the hood.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This repository covers the **fundamental data structures**, grouped as follows:

### 🔹 Linear Data Structures
- **Array**
- **Linked List** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Stack**
- **Queue** (Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Deque, Priority Queue)

### 🔹 Non-linear Data Structures
- **Tree**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree (Self-balancing)
- **Graph**
  - Adjacency Matrix representation
  - Adjacency List representation
  - Traversal Algorithms (DFS, BFS)

### 🔹 Hash-based Structures
- **Hash Table**
  - Chaining
  - Open Addressing (Linear & Quadratic Probing)

## 🛠 Implementations

Each data structure is implemented as a separate Python file/class.  
Example:
```

/DataStructures
├── array.py
├── linked\_list.py
├── stack.py
├── queue.py
├── binary\_tree.py
├── bst.py
├── avl\_tree.py
├── graph.py
├── hash\_table.py
